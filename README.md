- The goal of this project was to start up Firefox along with turing on the wifi and a 
  vpn at the same time. (VPN via rasdial module within CMD.)
  Once firefox.exe is terminated, the wifi will disconnect along with the vpn.
  Designed to conserve some battery and hide from microsoft data collection services.

- Comes with VPN configuration within the console.

- PSLIST.exe & Telnet.exe are required for this program to work.
  Both can or will be installed automatically by the foxmic console and will place them in the correct directories.
  Telnet.exe is a built in Windows file.
